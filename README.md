This repository is associated with Wang AG, Son M, et al., "NF-ÎºB memory coordinates transcriptional responses to dynamic inflammatory stimuli". Included are the scripts and data necessary to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.

The scripts are:
f1and2_supps.m - necesssary to produce figures 1 and 2 and associated supplmental figures
f4_supps.m - necessary to produce figure 4 and associated supplemental figures
f5and6_supps.m - necessary to produce figure 5 and associated supplmental figures for figure 5 and 6
f6_rcode.r - necessary to produce sequencing and qPCR figures for figure 6 

All data are called in the appropriate scripts
